(* This is my implementation of Red-Black Trees for OCaml. It is based upon
 * "Red-Black Trees in a Functional Setting", Chris Okasaki in "Functional
 * Pearls".
 * Red-Black Trees are exposed via a map and a set API, which is designed to
 * be compatible with the Map and Set modules in the OCaml standard library
 * (which are implemented using AVL trees). You can use the Rbmap and Rbset
 * modules as drop-in replacement for the Map and Set modules.
